This repository implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in Python to classify images of cats and dogs from the popular Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset.

The code provides a basic framework for:

* Loading the dataset from Kaggle
* Preprocessing and feature scaling of image data (optional)
* Training an SVM classifier with a linear kernel (experiment with different kernels)
* Evaluating model performance on a testing set

This is a starting point for exploring SVM-based image classification. You can extend it by:

* Tuning SVM hyperparameters for better accuracy
* Exploring data augmentation techniques

Feel free to explore, contribute, and improve this repository!
